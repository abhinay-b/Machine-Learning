# Machine-Learning
This repo consists of various machine learning algorithms:
- Regression:
    - Simple Linear Regression: We will build a simple linear regression method to estimate the amount of CO$_2$ emmitted related to a car's fuel consumption.
    - Multiple Linear Regression: We will build a multiple linear regression method to estimate the amount of CO$_2$ emmitted related to a car's fuel consumption, number of cylinders and engine size.
- Classification:
    - Decision trees: We will build a decision trees model to predict the best drug medication that a new patient would respond to.
    - K Nearest Neighbours: We will build a KNN model for customer segmentation of a telecom industry.
    - Logistic Regression: We will build a Logistic regression model for predicting whether a customer would leave a company for its competitor or not.
    - Support Vector Machines: We will build a SVM model to detect if a new patient would be diagonised with cancer.
    
    We will also build and compare all the classifiers to predict if a customer would default his loan or not. We will use accuracy measures like Jaccard similarity, F1 score and log loss(where applicable) for comparison.
- Clustering:
    - K-Means Clustering: We will build a k-means clustering model to group the customers with similar characteristics. 
    - Heirarchical Clustering: We will build a heirarchical clustering model to group similar vehicles so that all the competitors fall into same category. A new car can then be fitted to its right competitors.
    - Density Based Clustering: We will use density based clustering model to group all weather stations that show similar weather conditions while avoiding outliers and noise points efficiently.
    
Finally, we build a __recommender system__ using __collaborative filtering__ and __content based filtering__ for recommending movies to a user.

Modules Used: Numpy, sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, scipy.
